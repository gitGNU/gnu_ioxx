* TODO specialiation for =size(iovec const &)= doesn't compile with ICC 9.11

  Boost 1.35 defines that function to return =range_difference<T>::type= -- the
  signed type =byte_offset= for us --, but the current specialization returns
  =byte_size=, which is unsigned.

* TODO Boost libraries don't compile on AIX.

  The header-only libraries probably work, but Boost.Build doesn't seem to know
  about the IBM xlC++ compiler. Is it a good idea to use Boost.System after
  all? It's the only link library ioxx really needs at this point. The unit
  tests also need the unit_test_framework, naturally, but not being able to
  build those is a smaller problem than not being able to build the actual
  library. A simple replacement class for =system_error= might make things a
  lot easier.
