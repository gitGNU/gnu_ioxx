	This file is no longer used because the change history is available
        on-line directly from the GIT repository that contains the master
        versions of these files. To see the change log, direct your favorite
        web browser to the following location:

	  http://git.cryp.to/?p=ioxx;a=shortlog

	For every release tarball, there is an appropriate tag of the same name
        to identify the GIT version that particular release was built from.

	The same information is also available in other representations
        suitable for subscription:

	  ATOM Log:  http://git.cryp.to/?p=ioxx;a=atom
